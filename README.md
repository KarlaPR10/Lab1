Tasks
1. Branch Strategy Simulation

Trunk Based Development:
Initialize a new repository and simulate a continuous integration environment by committing small changes directly to the main branch. Demonstrate quick feature integration and frequent commits.

GitFlow:
Set up a develop branch alongside the main branch. Create feature branches for new developments, merge them back into develop, and then finish with a release branch that merges into main.

2. Conflict Resolution and Merging
Participants will simulate development scenarios that lead to conflicts, requiring them to choose between merging and rebasing to resolve these issues. They will:
Create branches that modify the same file in different ways to generate conflicts.
Use Git commands to resolve these conflicts through merging or rebasing.
Discuss the outcomes and choose the best strategy for various situations.
